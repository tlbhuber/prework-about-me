      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am not really sure what I am doing.  During the Covid-19 Pandemic, I lost my job and decided that I wanted a complete change in careers.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived in 5 different states...so the answer to this is "a bunch of places".</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am too boring to have anything that would be considered a "hobby".</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Anything that will allow me to use the skill sI will be learning in the Coding Bootcamp as well as allow me to take care of my family.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Monroe Township, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always wanted to do this, but since I went directly from High School to working, I never thought I could.  When the opportunity presented itself, I jumped on it.</p>
